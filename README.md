Snackr is an open-source, real-time snack selection site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and based heavily on [Telescope](http://telesc.pe).

Proposed features:
- Budget feature. Admins can set and edit a budget
- Total cost. Admins can see what the top items in a category will cost
- Amazon/Drizly/other api integration. Adding to a cart should only take one click
